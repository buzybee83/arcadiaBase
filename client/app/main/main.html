        <p>The idea behind this project was to create a web app in the MEAN Stack, but instead of using socket.io, implement the use of Firebase. Firebase lets you store & sync data to all connected clients in realtime. Although it is also a noSQL databse as well, I'm still using MongoDB to store my data and users. Only using Firebase for the "real-time" game play</p>

        <h3>Play Tetris</h3>
        Play by yourself or have tons of fun with an oponent!
        <h4>2 Player - Rules</h4>
        For every 4 rows cleared, a row will get pushed to your oponent. Use the LEFT, RIGHT, and DOWN arrow keys to move left, right, or down respectively. Use the UP key to change rotation of the falling piece. If you feel confident about your location, press the SPACE BAR for fast drop!
