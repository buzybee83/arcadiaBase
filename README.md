#Arcadia BASE#

The idea behind this project was to create a web app in the MEAN Stack, but instead of using socket.io, implement the use of Firebase. Firebase lets you store & sync data to all connected clients in realtime. Although it is also a noSQL databse as well, I'm still using MongoDB to store my data and users. Only using Firebase for the "real-time" game play
